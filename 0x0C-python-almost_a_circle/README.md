# Python - Almost a circle

This project is part of the Higher Level curriculum and aims to review various concepts in Python. It covers a wide range of topics including imports, exceptions, classes, private attributes, getters/setters, class methods, static methods, inheritance, unit testing, and file I/O. Additionally, you will also learn about args and kwargs, serialization/deserialization, JSON, and more.

## Resources

Before starting this project, it is recommended to review the following topics:

- [args and kwargs](https://realpython.com/python-kwargs-and-args/)
- [JSON encoder and decoder](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html)
- [unittest module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
- [Python test cheatsheet](https://www.pythonsheets.com/notes/python-tests.html)

## Learning Objectives

Upon completing this project, you should be able to:

- Explain the concept of unit testing and implement it in a large project
- Serialize and deserialize a class object
- Read from and write to a JSON file
- Understand and use *args in function definitions
- Understand and use **kwargs in function definitions
- Handle named arguments effectively in functions

## Copyright - Plagiarism

To meet the learning objectives of this project, you must come up with your own solutions for the tasks. Copying and pasting someone else's work is strictly forbidden. Publishing any content related to this project is not allowed. Plagiarism will result in removal from the program.

- Modules, classes, and functions should be documented properly

### Python Unit Tests

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files should end with a new line
- Test files should be located inside a folder named "tests"
- unittest module must be used for testing
- Test files should be python files with the extension .py
- Test files and folders should start with `test_`
- Test file organization should mirror the project's file structure
- All tests should be executed using `python3 -m unittest discover tests`
- Individual test files can be executed using `python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base.py`

**Note:** It is highly recommended to collaborate with your peers to ensure comprehensive test coverage and account for all possible edge cases.
