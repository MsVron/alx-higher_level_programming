# File Operations in Python

This repository contains Python scripts that demonstrate various file operations, such as reading and writing files, using Python programming language. The purpose of this project is to provide hands-on experience and understanding of file manipulation techniques in Python.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will gain knowledge and proficiency in the following areas:

- Understand the advantages and versatility of Python programming language.
- Learn how to open a file in Python.
- Explore different methods for reading and writing text in a file.
- Understand how to read the full content of a file.
- Learn how to process a file line by line.
- Gain knowledge on cursor movement within a file.
- Understand the importance of closing a file after use.
- Learn to use the `with` statement for file handling.
- Understand the basics of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).
- Learn serialization and deserialization concepts.
- Gain proficiency in converting Python data structures to JSON strings and vice versa.

## Requirements

- Python Scripts:
  - Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
  - All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
  - All files should end with a new line
  - The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
  - Your code should follow the PEP 8 style guide (version 2.8.*)
  - All files must be executable
  - The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

- Python Test Cases:
  - Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
  - All test files should end with a new line
  - All test files should be inside a folder named `tests`
  - All test files should be text files with a `.txt` extension
  - All tests should be executed using the command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
  - All modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
  - All classes should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
  - All functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
  - The documentation should be descriptive, providing a clear explanation of the purpose of the module, class, or method.
